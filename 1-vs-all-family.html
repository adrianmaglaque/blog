      To become successful you have to have these things: Team, Consistency, Purpose, Willingness, Good at Communicating, Know how to manipulate human behavior, Study from the best of the best, Know how to sell your self to others, Understanding the incomprehensible,
      Knowing how to analyze other people's action in order to understand and do it yourself, knowing people nature base on their expression if they're faking or not, willing to leave family in order to achieve success, not showing your emotion in front of people, giving time to yourself and not expecting success in such short time, learn how to do things, learn what to do, etc.

      but what if you dont have a team or family to support you? will you give up? knowing that other people have friends and families to support them should not let you down and give up. <br><br>

      You can do this yourself if you only try and someone will help you achieve your goal, only if you try, this possibility will come in the future, if you don't give up and keep you mindset and goals. <br><br>

      Keep reminding yourself what you're here for, what your goals are.
      <br><br>
      Telling yourself that you don't have any time to waste anymore but to do this goal that you've been dreaming of.
      <br><br>
      Tell to yourself that even if this life is dangerous you will not run away.
      <br><br>
      You will prove all the people who tell you that you are shit, and told you will not achieve anything in your life that you are just average person, and just "enjoy life" because "you will die anyway"
      and "you will not get the money you make when you are in heaven", sounds familiar? thats the people who never try hard to achieve anything in life and just make excuses for the result they get and never willing to do anything in order to achieve their goals. <br><br>

      these people will instill their mindset into you, and its up to you
      if you are going to listen to them, all the things thats happening in your life is your fault, if life throw rocks to you, its your job to dodge it and not cry why this is happening to you and have victim mentality, blaming everything around you, you are the only person who will support you, don't expect anyone to feed you, make  your own plan and decision on how you will win in this world full of bullshits and inequality.

      Learn to use the information that the world is giving to you, use this time to get all the information you needed for your success. <br><br>

      Because you the only one who control yourself, don't go around people's lives and solve their life.

      <br><br>

      You have your own life, and that's what you're going to solve, not other's people life, you will help them but don't solve their problem.

      <br><br>

      I have experience always solving people's problems, and what i learned from that is never help people that don't want to do anything in order to achieve success.

      <br><br>

      This people want to be rich, but don't want to do anything to achieve it, crazy right?

      <br><br>
      Imagine if you help the right people that want success and will help you to achieve it, you did not waste your time and boost your success speed rate. 

      <br><br>
      Im not saying don't help people who's "purposeless", but there are other people who can help them, and that's not suppose to be you. <br><br>

      YOUR GOAL IS TO BE "SUCCESSFUL" IN ORDER TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE, NOT "WASTE YOUR TIME" TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE AND BE UNSUCCESSFUL. 
      <br><br>

      you can give them money if you become successful, but you can't give them money when you're NOT and worst case scenario, your help is NOT enough and they will say it in your face with ungrateful attitude.
      
      <br><br>
      So the best plan is to be "labeled" as "Selfish" than accepting the worst case scenario.

      <br><br>
      Let them hate you for not helping them, and working to be successful, you know that it's for them and their future so you can help them better.

      <br><br>
      There's one thing that i want you to remember is that, dont waste your time now and start working on your goal and stop saying "One day i will be this and that", start working now because keep moving forward is the only way to achieve success, and that "One day" may not come.

      You may not have the family or team to help you, or maybe you have family but they already gave up trying, but you have to remember that you still have you, and that "you" should not give up.


      <br><br>

      We are all struggling because we are all human, but why choose the easy way and give up?, thats the thing I don't understand, we all age and die, but thats when waste our time and regret it later when we are old and weak.

      <br><br>

      The thing that stick to my mind is have "High Standard", or the quotes: "Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars", I think the people who don't try their best and giving up, is the one who's selfish and only thinking their own.

      <br><br>

      It's easy to give up, but its hard to try, thats why i like the people who tried their best to become successful even if its hard and dangerous, not the people who take things from others in order to survive, people who uses the loudness of their voice to win, and the most thing i hate the most is the people who use their strength that "inequality" gave to them in order to get what they want from people, being arrogant that they're so strong and telling people to just "shut the fuck up" and let them get what they want, the bossy people.

      <br><br>

      That's the people i hate the most, and thats why i work hard to achieve my purpose, not to have fun and die not trying because I'm scared that im not gonna make it and people will not let me.

      <br><br>

      I also want to be free, and that will not come unless i achieve my goals.

      <br><br>

      BIG RESPECT TO PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS TRY AND NOT GIVING UP EVEN IF LIFE SAYS "NO".
