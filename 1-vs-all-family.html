      Year 2022 i stopped and I took a break in school, I never regretted it.  
    <br><br>
        Taking a break from school was never in my mind, but a lot happened before that.

        Family problems, School Past, Things that didn't do well, I'ts been on my head everyday. Having anxiety every year when enrolling to school, Going to school that i didn't like anymore. Breaking things and lot of cries, Dont know what happened to me but it seems like i had no choice but sell my soul and throw everything that i like. But what career should i choose to get this done?, Watching every successful people on their early careers, watching what they did, decisions that they've done, their realizations, the mindset that they have, watching them prove wrong the people that told them that they would be nothing. <br>

      Having a year break, never thought that would help me to go back to my old self, just me enjoying music, breaking the continuous dreams that i want to pursue and throwing it away far away, like the feeling when i was just a child. <br><br>
      
      Flying away from people that i thought were RIGHT people to help but they were not, big mistake, big waste of time, a big shitty mistake.
