      Unfortunately this is not a random blog post because i post it.
    <br><br>
        
        But What is random actually? Does it Actually Exist?

      <p class="body-blog"><br>

        I watch the Vsauce Video about randomness and something spark in my head<br><br>


        Why do we call SOMETHING a "RANDOM" when we dont know what the thing is?<br><br>

        like RANDOM NUMBER of 0.3224151523... <br><br>

        We know that 1 + 1 = 2 and IT'S NOT RANDOM, ITS 100% ACCURATE <br><br>

        BUT WHY IT'S NOT? JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW IT THATS WHY IT'S NOT RANDOM? <br><br>

        IF WE DONT KNOW SOMETHING WE CALLED IT RANDOM.

        <br><br>

        WHAT If we dont know <br> what is the answer to 1 + 1? <br><br>

        Is there a 100% We CALL it RANDOM?

      <p class="body-blog">
        Why did you get born in this WORLD?
        <br><br>

        Is it RANDOM? NO IT'S NOT <br><br>

        Your Parents Did Make Love of Each other in BED thats why You are BORN AND ITS NOT "RANDOM!", AND another FACTOR is  
        
        <br><br>

        The Eggcell Chooses you to get in, so IT IS NOT ALSO "RANDOM!"

        <br><br>

        We Just Call THINGS RANDOM Because we dont know why certain things work, or how things are form, and the things are not making sense to us, is we calling it RANDOM!

        <br><br>

        So You can say that LUCK IS NOT REAL, OR LUCK IS NOT A RANDOM LUCK, THERES IS NO LUCK IS THIS WORLD. 

        <br><br>

        IF you GOT UNLUCKY that's not RANDOMLY UNLUCKY, there is a reason WHY IS THAT HAPPENING TO YOU, and IT MIGHT BE your FAULT, or IT MIGHT SOMEBODY'S FAULT, and to know THE RANDOMNESS, YOU HAVE TO LEARNED WHAT IS THAT RANDOMNESS. 
        <br><br>

        IF YOU ARE NOT RICH RIGHT NOW, THAT IS NOT RANDOMLY UNLUCKY, THERES A REASON WHY YOU ARE POOR, AND YOU CAN MAKE IT "RANDOMLY NOT RANDOM" AND BE RICH, IF YOU KNOW "WHAT IS THE EXACT ANSWER" IS, AND "NOT RANDOMLY SAY AN ANSWER OR RANDOMLY TAKE AN ACTION".

        <br><br>

        WHAT IS RANDOMLY ANSWER and ACTION? <br><br>

        RANDOMLY ANSWER is WHEN YOU "ANSWER BUT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS!", "YOU ARE GUESSING AND YOU ARE NOT CHOOSING THE UNRANDOMLY CORRECT ANSWER!" THE CORRECT AND NOT JUST RANDOMLY ANSWER!

        <br><br>

        SAME AS RANDOMLY ACTION, Sometimes we as Humans we often says, "Whatever Dude just wing it", AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CALLED "RANDOMLY ACTION", DOING THINGS INTUITIVELY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE RIGHT ACTION TO TAKE OR DECISION TO TAKE!, SO WE RANDOMLY DO THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T ACCURATELY CALCULATED BUT WE STILL SAY "F*CK IT, 
        
        JUST WING IT", AND WHEN YOU GOT F*CKED UP "NOT RANDOMLY" BUT YOU MADE AN UNRANDOMLY CHOICE TO MAKE AN INACCURATE RANDOM CALCULATION AND OUTCOME OF THAT CALCULATION", AND THEN WHEN YOU GOT 

        F*CKED UP, THEN YOU'LL SAY, YOU ARE SO "RANDOMLY UNLUCKY" 
        
        BUT IT'S "NOT RANDOMLY UNLUCKY", IT'S YOU, WHO "UNRANDOMLY 
        
        CHOOSES" TO "MAKE A RANDOMLY INACCURATE CALCULATION AND AN OUTCOME OF THAT CALCULATION".
        
        <br><br>
        AND IT'S SO RANDOM TO OUR VISION AND BRAIN, THAT WHEN SOMETHING IS DIFFUCULT OR SHOULD I SAY "RANDOM", WE DONT EVEN STUDY IT, OR TAKE THE EFFORT TO SEE IT AS "NOT RANDOM". 

        <br><br>

        IF WE STUDY THE THINGS THAT ARE "DIFFICULTY" OR THINGS THAT WE "DON'T UNDERSTAND" OR YOU MIGHT CALL IT "RANDOM"

        <br><br>
        Then NO MORE "RANDOM" TO US, AND WE CAN KEEP MOVING FORWARD AS WE WANT TO, BECAUSE THERES NO MORE "RANDOMNESS",BECAUSE WE "CONQUERED" IT, WE "STUDIED" IT, AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT "RANDOM" AND THERES A REASON THING WHY IT "DOES" WHAT IT DOES!,

        <br><br>

        BEING RICH AND WEALTHY BECAUSE YOU ARE LEARNING THE "RANDOM" THINGS IN YOUR LIFE, AND KNOW ABOUT IT, MEANS YOU ARE LEARNING WHAT IS NOT THE "RANDOM" THING TO DO, AND EVERYTHING YOU DO IS NOT "RANDOM" AT ALL, AND THERE'S A REASON BEHIND EVERY ACTION OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS NOT "RANDOM"!, EVERY OUTCOME THAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF YOUR CALCULATION AND NOT RANDOMLY ACTION.

        <br><br>

        THEREFORE YOU CAN SAY THAT, EVERYTHING THAT IS A RANDOM MUST BE LEARNED! SO IT'S NOT RANDOM TO US ANYMORE, SO WE CAN SAY THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO SHOULD NOT BE "RANDOM" SO WE CAN ACHIEVE SUCCESS THAT WE WANTED!
