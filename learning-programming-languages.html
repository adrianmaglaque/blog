    This one works for me but it might not work for you,  it might not work for you.    
  
      
    <br><br>
      In my years in programming, i've learn that learning another language is really easy if you know what you are doing, I want you to understand that when doing these steps and you are learning through youtube, or text, is that following along in tutorial is really important and dont go on your own without finishing the tutorial, because you will be confused when you messed up and you have to go back to zero to follow along again, your time would be wasted, and your day would be ruined.
    
    </p><hr>

    <p class="body-blog"><br>

      1. Grasp: Know what you are going to learn. <br>

      Obtain a comprehensive cheatsheet (PDF) that covers all the elements of the language you're trying to learn. <br><br>
      Print out the cheatsheet to have a physical reference. <br><br>
      
      This ensures you can study even without an internet connection, and you can review it anytime to refresh your memory.<br><br>

      Since you have the cheatsheet printed you dont need to list all of the syntaxes and elements because its all there already. you need this cheatsheet list to undertand and see the progress or percentages that you are making in learning these projects, you will be crossing each syntaxes/elements that you finished learning and moving from one to another until the end.(AND THATS THE BORING PART OF IT, BUT AFTER DOING IT YOU WILL FEEL THE POWER FLOWING IN YOUR HEAD) 

      <br><br>
      Commit to learning all the listed elements. Search for each element on the internet, understand its purpose, and once you grasp it, cross it off the list and move on to the next one.

      <br><br>

      The goal of this step is not to memorize the language but to expose yourself to all the elements that you might encounter while building projects,NOTE: as long as you finish all the list thats all that matters. By doing this, you'll be able to understand better when someone, like a professor or mentor, explains concepts related to these elements in the future. It enables fast and uninterrupted communication during your learning journey.

    <p class="body-blog"><br>

      2. The actual learning. <br><br>

      Instead of just learning the language in theory, focus on learning it in practice by creating projects.<br><br>
      
      Begin by creating ten projects per language you are learning. <br><br>
      
      Honestly i would not tell to my self that i know the language already unless i completed the 10 basic random projects. <br>
      These 10 projects is just fucking around grasping and using the language itself so don't worry if you somehow failed doing the projects, its no big deal (YOU'RE NOT GONNA INCLUDE THIS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO UNLESS YOU WANT TO),  just retry over and over, do it right and faster the next time you do it again.
      
      <br><br>

      These projects don't have to be complex; the key is to complete them and get hands-on experience with the language.
      
      <br><br>

      After finishing these initial projects, challenge yourself to work on "REAL PROJECTS" â€“ real-world problem solutions that you can showcase in your portfolio. 

      <br><br> -Help companies by solving their complex problems other than BASIC CALCULATOR PROJECT, TIMERS and ETC.
      
      <br><br>
      
      These projects should be more complex and involve greater effort.
      
      <br><br>

      NOTE: The purpose of creating ten projects is to develop a strong understanding of using the language in practical applications, not just through theoretical learning.

    </p><hr>


    
    <p class="body-blog"><br>


      In summary, follow these steps to learn any language effectively:
      
      <br><br>

      1. List the syntaxes of the language you want to learn or get the (pdf) cheatsheet and print it.

      <br>

      2. Ensure you learn all the listed syntaxes, crossing them out as you go to immerse yourself in the language.
      
      <br>
      3. Learn by building projects because practical application offers better comprehension.
      
      <br><br>
      Having a PDF cheatsheet and printing it out provides you with a reliable and accessible reference throughout your learning journey. 
      
      <br><br>
      
      This is my way of learning a new programming language, i'm not saying that this would work for you, but this is what i do whenever i learn new languages, after doing this steps i be go and the build 10 projects and i'd easily understand the tutorial hell projects because i studied the syntaxes/elements to help me understand these explanations, and after these 10 projects i be stopping doing these tutorial hell and go build my own, without help, applying everything that i learned, and making it my own. <br><br>

      always remember that if you dont understand anything and you got some errors or bugs, you are not perfect, google is always your friend, and dont ever try to think it hard if you know that you dont know the right answer, always remember that you can't always do shit yourself and you should use things that the world is giving you.<br><br>
