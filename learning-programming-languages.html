    This blog post is not perfect and it will never be perfect, but I will still try to perfect it, even if it's difficult.    
  
      
    <br><br>

      
      In my years in programming, i've learn that learning another language is really easy if you know what you are doing, and thats what we are going to talk about, is that learning a language is really easy but hard at the same time and the way you can succeed in learning a language is in these steps.
    <br><br>
    </p><hr>

    <p class="body-blog">

      1. Grasp - Know what you are going to learn. <br><br>

      -Having a cheatsheet (PDF) that tells you all the elements of the language. <br><br>

      -Print it all.<br><br>

      Plus Advantages: You will Have the reference with or without wifi and you can study them everywhere.

      <br><br>

      -Fun Hunting: After you print it, all the list of elements, 
      learn all of them, search them in the internet, make you you understand them,
      and after you learn about one element, cross-it, and go to the next one. <br><br>
      
      
      The goal is not to memorize the language but to expose yourself
      to all the elements that you might encounter when building a projects.

      <br><br>

      Someone might tell something or explain something and you might not relate
      to what the person is saying because you dont expose to that element or syntax yet. <br><br>

      So the point is to expose yourself to language in order to understand what is 
      the other person (MENTOR) that might explain things to you in the future when you're making your projects, so you could have fast communication with them, and your learning is continously without any interruptions.
    </p><hr>


    <p class="body-blog">

      2. The actual learning. <br><br>

      The way you learn is by creating a project not learning a language. <br><br>

      So when i started programming this is the things i do in order to maximize my skills in programming: <br><br>


      -create 10 projects per language that im learning.
      <br><br>
      -it doesnt have to be complex as long i complete 10 projects
      <br><br>
      -after 10 projects i have to create a "REAL PROJECTS", which is creating real world problem solutions, that i can put into my portfolio so i can have projects to show, a projects that difficult to make.

      <br><br>

      -the purpose of creating 10 projects is to have a grasp of using the actual language instead of learning it just by reading.

    </p><hr>


    
    <p class="body-blog">


      These steps help me to learn any language that I want to learn.

      <br><br>

      1. LIST THE SYNTAXES OF LANGUAGE THAT YOU WANT TO LEARN. <br>
      2. MAKE SURE TO LEARN ALL OF THEM AND CROSS THEM OUT, EXPOSING YOURSELF TO LANGUAGE ITSELF. <br>
      3. LEARN BY BUILDING A PROJECTS BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS WHY? <br><br>

      having the pdf and printing it, I think is the best.
